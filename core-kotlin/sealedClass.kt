We can also apply the use of Sealed classes in different examples in the Android Project. 
Suppose you want to display different types of Result:

sealed class Result {
     data class Success(val data: Data) : Result()
     data class Error(val exception: Exception) : Result()
}
//Consider Data as a model class which holds the result
Here, we have a data class success object which contains the success Data and a data class Error object 
which contains the state of the error.

This way, Sealed classes help us to write clean and concise code! Thatâ€™s all the information about 
Sealed classes and their usage in Kotlin.
