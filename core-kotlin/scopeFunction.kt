    LET
    // using let ,we have following usecase

    people.map(it.length).filter(it->3).let{

/*
    RUN
    we use run when we want to initialise object and perform some operations on it

    Person(name,nickName){
        val address:String
        getAddress(){

        }
    }

    val saurabhAddress=Person("saurabh","sd").run{
        this.address="sector 10A,guragaon,haryana ,india"
        this.getAddress()
    }

    // thus we would get the address

*/

/*
    APPLY
    Person(name,nickName){
        val address:String
        val hobbies:String
        getAddress(){

        }
    }

    initialise the object

    // old school way
    heman= Person("heman","he")
    heman.address="NY"
    heman.hobbies="fly"
    print(heman)

    // using apply
    heman=Person("heman","he").apply{
        this.address="NY"
        this.hobbies="fly"
    }

    // we can remove this context as, when using apply context is clear
    
    // we could not use run because it  returns new object but we want the same object thats why this
    // run return last fun, wheras apply return context object

*/

/*
    ALSO
    used when we want to perform some of the side effects like consider following usecase
    names=ListOf("sauranj","sahil","shayanaya")
    val results=names.map{it.length}.filter{it>5}
    // results would be [7,9]
    but if we want to debug the intermediate list then
    
    old school way is
    break the chain and then create two variables and log them

    // use also
    name.map{
        it.length
    }.also{
        print(it)
    }.filter{
        it>3
    }
